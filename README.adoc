## Development instructions
The supported `node` version is `v6`. If you run into building errors, please make sure that you are using NodeV6 by running `node --version`. 

`package.json`: This is where scripts that get run when you use `npm run blah` get defined.
It'll be helpful to have an idea of what's available and where the magic `npm run` commands
are coming from. You can run any of those commands without the `npm run` meta-command.

### Dependencies

####  NPM packages
This will install dependencies saved in `package.json` and `flow-typed` repository.


```shell
$ npm run setup
```


#### ngind and ngWallet-cli
##### ngind
If ngind isn't available in your project directory, upon launching the app, it will automatically
be downloaded and placed in your project base dir.

##### ngWallet-cli
If you haven't got `ngWallet-cli` already installed on your system, you can execute `./dependencies.sh`
to automatically `rustup` and use `cargo` to install `ngWallet-cli` and move it to the
project's base dir. Note: this command is idempotent __for rust and cargo__ (it won't
try to install cargo if you've already got it), but it will
use cargo's `-f` flag to force install `ngWallet-cli` and copy that version to the
project directory.

### Run for development

Firstly: a couple things aren't working right.

- _Issue 1_: `webpack-dev-server` isn't working right with the current babel-webpack-electron-izing
  setup. So you've got to do your development in Electron for now. Which means you can't run `npm run start:web`. Bummer.

With these caveats in mind, __you can run__:

_Terminal 1_
```shell
# This will begin a live-watching compiler for ./src/ and ./electron/ folders
$ npm run build:all
```

_Terminal 2_
```shell
# This will begin the simulated electron app pulling from those compiled sources.
$ npm run start:electron
```

### Logs

#### Wallet logs
Electron and Ngin logs persisted in:

 * OSX: `~/Library/Logs/ngWallet/log.log`
 * Linux: `~/.config/ngWallet/log.log`


#### ngind logs
During development, you'll find ngind logs in `./logs` right within the project base directory.

On production, logs will be nestled in

 * OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/ngWallet/`
 * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\ngWallet\logs`

### Building alternatively

You can also use a variety of alternative building options, eg.

```
$ npm run build:all:nowatch
$ npm run build:web
```

### Building distributions in development
You can run a distribution build in your development environment. Assuming
you've already compiled `./src/` and `./electron/`, you'll be able to run:

```
$ npm run dist
```

This command will build for _your current system_. Note that there are configurations for
several systems (OSX, Linux, Windows) specified on the `"build"` field of `package.json`, but the `dist` command will (by default) only build for the system it's on.

Note: If you're developing on OSX and have a developer signing identity on your machine, you can
optionally disable that with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`.

OSX is also able to build for Linux. Add `-ml` to that raw command to build for
both OSX and Linux at the same time.

### Troubleshooting
Some preliminary things to try in case you run into issues:

- Clear out any persisted settings or userdata from previous trials
 * OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/ngWallet`
 * Linux: `~/.config/ngWallet`
 * Windows: `%APPDATA%\ngWallet`
